**Introduction**
In the realm of numerical solutions for linear systems of equations, iterative methods provide a systematic process to approximate solutions. This report describes the implementation of two iterative methods: the Jacobi method and the Gauss-Seidel method, in C++.

**Methods Used**

**Jacobi Iterative Method**
-It decomposes the matrix A into a diagonal component D and a remainder R.
-The iterative formula: x = (b - R*x0) / D
-The iterations continue until the L2 norm (Euclidean distance) of the difference between subsequent solutions becomes less than a specified error.

**Gauss-Seidel Iterative Method**
-This method enhances the Jacobi method by using the updated values as soon as they are known.
-The matrix A is decomposed into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.
-The iterative formula: x = inv(L) * (b - U*x0)
-Like the Jacobi method, iterations continue until the L2 norm of the difference is below the specified error.

**Implementation Overview**
Diagonal Dominance Check: Before beginning iterations, the system checks if the matrix is strictly diagonally dominant because for these methods to guarantee convergence, diagonal dominance is essential.

User Interaction:
-The user specifies the number of equations.
-Coefficients can be input either through the command line or from a file.
-The user provides the desired error for convergence and an initial guess for the solution

Iteration and Convergence: The program iteratively computes solutions. If the desired accuracy isn't reached within 50 iterations, the method terminates, reporting the result of the 50th iteration.

**Results & Output**
For each method, the solution after each iteration is printed. The final output is the solution vector [x1, x2, ...]T for each method. The T indicates that it's a column vector.

Conclusion
Iterative methods, such as Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel, provide practical tools for approximating solutions to linear systems. While their convergence for arbitrary systems isn't guaranteed, they can efficiently solve diagonally dominant systems. This C++ program offers a robust interface for users to employ these methods and understand their workings.
